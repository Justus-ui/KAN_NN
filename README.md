# 🧠 Benchmarking Kolmogorov–Arnold Inspired Models  
**A Comparative Study of KANN, KAN, and Standard Neural Networks**  
*Master’s Thesis Project – TU Berlin*

This repository contains the implementation, experimentation, and evaluation of three neural network architectures: **Kolmogorov–Arnold Neural Networks (KANN)**, **Kolmogorov–Arnold Networks (KAN)**, and standard **Neural Networks (NN)**.

The project was conducted as part of a Master’s thesis at **Technische Universität Berlin**, with the goal of understanding how Kolmogorov–Arnold inspired models perform in comparison to traditional neural architectures on various tasks.

## 🧠 Models Evaluated

- **KANN** – *Kolmogorov–Arnold Neural Network*  
- **KAN** – *Kolmogorov–Arnold Network*  
- **NN** – *Standard Feedforward Neural Network (MLP)*  

All models were evaluated under consistent training setups to enable fair benchmarking.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Evaluate the performance and generalization capabilities of KANN and KAN models  
- Benchmark against traditional neural networks across classification and regression tasks  
- Analyze convergence behavior, training efficiency, and model complexity  
- Provide reproducible results for future research and comparative studies
